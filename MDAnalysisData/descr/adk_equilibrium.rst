====================================
 AdK equilibrium trajectory dataset
====================================

MD trajectory of apo adenylate kinase with CHARMM27 force field and
simulated with explicit water and ions in NPT at 300 K and 1
bar. Saved every 240 ps for a total of 1.004 Âµs. Produced on PSC
Anton. The trajectory only contains the protein and all solvent
stripped. Superimposed on the CORE domain of AdK by RMSD fitting.

The topology is contained in the PSF file (CHARMM format). The
trajectory is contained in the DCD file (CHARMM/NAMD format).
